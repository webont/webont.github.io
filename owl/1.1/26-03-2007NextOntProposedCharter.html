<h1>TOTAL STRAW DRAFT</h1>
<p>Version as of <b>March</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b> </b>26, 2007</span>.</p>
<p>Feedback welcome; preferably via the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/">public-owl-dev@w3.org</a>
mailing list.</p>
<p>The charter should be scoped so as to constrain the WG to
produce
a relatively small,
predictable addition to OWL. The motivations for such an addition
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consideration of the Webont WG's many <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html">postponed
issues</a>, and the partially met or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/#section-goals">unmet
goals</a>.</li>
<li>Recent work by theoreticians and implementors shows that
there
are some "easy wins" that would partially meet some long standing user
demands.</li>
<li>Without ongoing development, users (and potential users)
with
currently unsatisfied requirements may consider moving away from OWL.
(Must be balanced with need to avoid destabalisation.)</li>
<li>Some things can be and perhaps properly are handled by
other groups, but other things really seem to require work
on OWL itself (such as QCRs or axiom annotations).</li>
<li>Making OWL more XML friendly, on the one
hand, and human reader friendly, on the other, could help
adoption by new user communities.</li>
<li>Other (potentially important) issues (such as synthesis
with
other languages/paradigms) should be excluded if they are not currently
well enough understood or lack community consensus.</li>
<li>The WG should be tightly focused and of short duration; the
charter should facilitate this without being too restrictive.</li>
</ul>
<p>This draft was written by <a href="mailto:horrocks@cs.man.ac.uk">Ian Horrocks</a>
and <a href="mailto:bparsia@cs.man.ac.uk">Bijan Parsia</a>
with
feedback from various people, including the attendees of <a href="http://owl-workshop.man.ac.uk/OWLWorkshop06.html">OWLED
2006</a>, participants in <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/">public-owl-dev</a>,
and the W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/CG/">Semantic
Web Coordination Group</a>.</p>
<p>Change log:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responding to concerns raised by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/CG/">SWCG</a>:
<ul>
<li>26-03-2007 Added new deliverable (Full style semantics)
and
added it to the schedule. Overall schedule length may need adjusting to
accomodate the work, but relative schedule seems ok (i.e., it is
plausible that the "core" documents which corrspond to the existing <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">submission
documents</a> will reach last call sooner). --BJP</li>
<li>26-03-2007 Added some links and emphasis, plus pointers
to past versions. Also a bit about CR near the schedule. --BJP</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Addressing Hendler's <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/2007JanMar/0036.html">follow
up</a> to the second comment,
adopting the wording change
<ul>
<li>17-01-2007 Split the "Rationalize species" bullet under
scope into two --BJP
<ul>
<li>I confess to being a bit leary of the change since it
enshrines the notion that the fragments in the TF document are "merely"
tractable. But anyway. --BJP</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Addressing Hendler's <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/2007JanMar/0016.html">second
comment</a>
<ul>
<li>15-01-2007 Tweaked the language for the illustration of
species rationalization to explicitly include "usable" and modified the
deliverables to mitigate the perceived bias of "tractable fragments";
also changed "tractable fragments" to "species" in the discussion of
what the wg can add or remove --BJP</li>
<li>15-01-2007 Tweaked deliverables to say more clearly that
the group could update or refactor the prior OWL recommendations --BJP</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Addressing Hendler's <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/2007JanMar/0012.html">first
comment</a>, basically adopting <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/2007JanMar/0015.html">Connolly's
proposal</a>
<ul>
<li>15-01-2007 Tweaked schedule to explicitly allow for up to
3
F2Fs ("up to" in the sense of 0-3; 0 is still possible) -- BJP</li>

<h1>[NextWebOnt]Working Group Charter</h1>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Modified from
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/04/ws-policy-charter.html">WS-Policy
charter</a></span></p>
<p>The mission of the [NextWebOnt] Working Group, part of the
Semantic
Web Activity, is to produce W3C Recommendations for an extension to the
Web Ontology Language (OWL) by refining the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">&#8220;OWL
1.1&#8221;
Member Submission</a>; it will address implementation experience
and
interoperability feedback (from the OWL 1.1 Member Submission),
maximize
compatibility with existing OWL ontologies, and produce a test suite
and suitable outreach material.</p>
<p>OWL 1.1 grew out of the <a href="http://www.mindswap.org/2005/OWLWorkshop/">first</a>
OWL: Experiences and Directions
(OWLED) workshop. It represents a relatively small set of extensions of
OWL
that 1) have been identified by users as widely needed and
2) have been identified by tool implementors as
reasonable and feasible extensions to current tools. At the <a href="http://owl-workshop.man.ac.uk/OWLWorkshop06.html">second</a>
OWLED workshop,
multiple implementations of editors and reasoners for OWL
1.1 were demonstrated, validating the design. Users at the workshop
indicated that this
relatively small addition to OWL would address a wide class of needs
and help further adoption of OWL.</p>
<p>OWL 1.1 also tried to refine certain aspects of OWL based
on user and implementor experience; e.g., by tightening of the
specification of the abstract syntax of OWL so as to better support
APIs, and to allow for a deterministic and round-tripable mapping from
the abstract syntax to RDF graphs.
</p>
<p>This Working Group shall be schedule-driven and OWL 1.1 shall
remain compatible, to the extent possible, with existing
implementations and
uses. This charter features an aggressive schedule and a tightly
constrained scope designed to ensure that the [NextWebOnt] will
meet its schedule. This charter is intended to carry OWL consensus and
interoperability forward, as outlined in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/05/rec-tips">Tips for Getting
to Recommendation Faster</a>.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The [NextWebOnt] Working Group is chartered to provide
incremental extensions to the Web Ontology Language (OWL). The
extensions are of the following sorts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extensions to the <span style="font-style: italic;">logic</span>
underlying OWL, adding new constructs that extend the
expressivity of OWL (e.g., qualified cardinality restrictions).</li>
<li>Extensions to the <span style="font-style: italic;">datatype
support</span>
provided by OWL, e.g., with XML Schema Datatypes and datatype facets.</li>
<li>Additional <span style="font-style: italic;">syntactic
sugar</span>,
i.e., constructors that do not extend the expressive power of OWL, but
that make some common modelling paradigms easier to express (e.g.,
disjoint unions).</li>
<li>Refinement of the OWL specification, e.g., a
rationalization
and tightening of the specification of the
abstract syntax of OWL so as to better support APIs, and to allow for a
deterministic and round-tripable mapping from the abstract
syntax to RDF graphs.</li>
<li>Additional concrete syntaxes for OWL ontologies. Notably, a
new XML format designed for easy parsing and maximal compatibility with
current XML practices.</li>
<li>Rationalization of the <span style="font-style: italic;">species</span>
of
OWL.</li>
<li>Identifying useful and usable sub-languages that are (more)
tractable
and/or efficiently implementable, e.g., with standard relational and
deductive database technology.</li>
<li>The Working Group should determine whether continuing the
"species" framework for end users is the best way to serve the OWL
community, or whether the identification of interesting fragments by
the Working Group is "merely" informative.</li>
</ul>
<p>The starting point for the Working Group is the OWL 1.1 member
submission: it defines expressive extensions for OWL, refined abstract
and XML syntaxes, and a mapping from the abstract syntax to RDF; it
also identifies several tractable fragments of OWL. In order to help
the Working Group to stay on schedule, this charter requires Working
Group <span style="font-style: italic;">consensus</span>
to add expressivity to OWL beyond that in the OWL 1.1 member
submission. The charter does not require Working Group consensus to
remove some of the additional functionality if it turns out to lead to
unanticipated difficulties. This charter also does not require Working
Group consensus to add additional concrete syntaxes
(e.g., more
"user
friendly" syntaxes), or to extend the range of species that
are identified; such extensions will, however, only be considered
provided that they do not have any adverse impact on the schedule.</p>
<p>The Working Group will work to ensure a smooth transition from
OWL
to OWL 1.1 by providing suitable outreach documents <b>(whether
new or as
updates to existing documents)</b>, and by striving to maximize
backwards
compatibility, especially of ontologies.</p>
<p>The Working Group will develop <b>an extension to the
OWL Test
Suite</b> covering the new functionality (and optionally more
extensive
coverage of old
functionality),
and differences, if any, with the existing language.</p>

<h2>Out of Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>Query languages (see the DAWG for SPARQL/DL)</li>
<li>Rules (see RIF)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dependancies</h2>
<p>The work is clearly related to the work of the DAWG and RIF
Working Groups, but is not dependant on that work. Close coordination
with
these Working Groups will, however, clearly be mutually beneficial.</p>
<h2><a name="meetings">Meetings</a></h2>
<p>The [NextWebOnt] intends to rely on distributed meetings;
however, if the Working Group determines it is necessary, it may
schedule 0 to 3 face-to-face meetings (that is, it is not required to
have any F2F meetings, but it may have as many as 3).</p>
<p>At least up until the Last Call period ends, a two-hour
Working Group
distributed meeting will be held every week; thereafter, a one and half
hour Working Group distributed meeting will be held every week. When
necessary, e.g., in order to meet agreed-upon deadlines, distributed
meetings may be
held twice a week.</p>
<p>
The [NextWebOnt] Working Group may adjust the timing and
duration of meetings to address the workload and assure that the goals
and schedule of this charter are achieved.
</p>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
<li>Functional-style Syntax (FS)</li>
<li>Core Semantics (CS)</li>
<li>Full Semantics (FuS)</li>
<li>Mapping to RDF (RS)</li>
<li>XML Syntax (XS)</li>
<li>Tractable Fragments/Rational Species (RaS)</li>
<li>Outreach
material (e.g., <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">overview</a>,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/">guide</a>,
reference, etc.)</li>
<li>Test Suite</li>
</ul>
<p>The above list refers to <span style="font-style: italic;">functionality</span>
not
documents. For example, it is up to the Working Group to determine
whether
having a combined FS, S, and RS document that is a direct update to the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/">OWL
Semantics and Abstract Syntax document</a>, or to follow the
submission
and keep them separate. Similarly, the publication status of each
document (Recommendation or Submission) is likewise up to the group.</p>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>This schedule is aggressive but contains built-in "slop". For
example, the first working drafts of most of the documents occur
"sometime" in months 2-4. Furthermore, there are already a number of
implementations of OWL 1.1 (see the <a href="http://owl1_1.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">OWL 1.1 page</a>
for a list), thus we could make the CR period for the core language
rather short.</p>
