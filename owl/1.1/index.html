<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is playing an important role in an
increasing number and range of applications, and is the focus of
research into tools, reasoning techniques, formal foundations and
language extensions. This level of experience with OWL means that the
community is now in a good position to discuss how OWL be applied,
adapted and extended to fulfil current and future application
demands. In particular, the initial design of OWL was conservative in
several ways: it excluded constructs that did not have considerable
support from within the W3C Web Ontology Working Group, or for which
effective reasoning methods were not known or expected to be shortly
known.
</p>

<p>
At the <a href="../../owl/2005/index.html">First OWL: Experiences and
Directions Workshop</a> (held in Galway, Ireland, on November 11-12
2005), the participants identified several restrictions of OWL that are
problematic in many applications, and that have been rendered
unnecessary by recent theoretical advances in logic-based Knowledge
Representation. As a result of the workshop, an extension of OWL-DL was
proposed. This extension, called OWL 1.1, is grounded on the above
mentioned theoretical advances, has a well defined model-theoretic
semantics, and is motivated by application requirements. The builders of
the major Semantic Web reasoners, namely. RACER, FaCT++, Pellet and
Cerebra expressed a committment to support OWL 1.1 in the near
future.

<h2>W3C OWL Working Group</h2>

<p>
OWL 1.1 became a 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">W3C Member
Submission</a>.
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/OWL_Working_Group">OWL W3C
Working Group</a> is
chartered to take the OWL 1.1 specification and produce a new W3C
recommendation for an updated OWL.
The working group maintains drafts of the documents that it is producing
for the new recommendation.  Pointers to these documents can be found on
the Working Group's
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/OWL_Working_Group">home page</a>.

Comments on the documents are welcome, but it is probably better to
comment on the documents that are being updated by the Working Group, 

Please send comments to <a

a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/">public

documents.

<p>The Wiki pages at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/w/list">http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/w/list</a> include
information about OWL 1.1 tools, ontologies, alternative syntaxes and discussions related to ongoing standardisation efforts.</p>

<p>The specification of OWL 1.1, as well as other possible extensions of OWL DL, are
currently being discussed through the above mentioned <a href="mailto:public-owl-dev@w3.org">public-owl-dev@w3.org</a>
mailing list. The usage of the old owl@lists.mindswap.org list has been discontinued;
the <a href="http://lists.mindswap.org/pipermail/owl/">archive</a> is, however, still available.</p>
