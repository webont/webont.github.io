<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is playing an important role in an increasing number and
range of applications, and is the focus of research into tools, reasoning techniques, formal
foundations and language extensions. This level of experience with OWL means that the community
is now in a good position to discuss how OWL be applied, adapted and extended to fulfil current
and future application demands. In particular, the initial design of OWL was conservative in
several ways: it excluded constructs that did not have considerable support from within the
W3C Web Ontology Working Group, or for which effective reasoning methods were not known or expected
to be shortly known.</p>

<p>At the First OWL: Experiences and Directions Workshop (held at Galway, Ireland, on November 11-12 2005),
the participants identified several restrictions of OWL that are problematic in many applications, and that
have been rendered unnecessary by recent theoretical advances in logic-based Knowledge Representation. As a
result of the workshop, an extension of OWL-DL was proposed. This extension, called OWL 1.1, is grounded on
the above mentioned theoretical advances, has a well defined model-theoretic semantics, and is motivated by
application requirements. The builders of the major Semantic Web reasoners, namely. RACER, FaCT++, Pellet
and Cerebra expressed a committment to support OWL 1.1 in the near future.</p>

<p>The OWL 1.1 specification is now a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">W3C Member Submission</a>.
The above documents are evolutions of (and, in the case of the MOF-Based Metamodel, an addition to) the documents

<h2>OWL:Expreriences and Directions Workshops</h2>

<p>The OWL: Experiences and Direction (OWLED) workshop series is a forum for practitioners in industry and academia,
tool developers, and others interested in OWL to describe real and potential applications, to share experience,
and to discuss requirements for language extensions/modifications. Discussions at OWLED workshops have played a key role
in the development of OWL 1.1.</p>

currently being discussed through the above mentioned <a href="mailto:public-owl-dev@w3.org">public-owl-dev@w3.org</a>
