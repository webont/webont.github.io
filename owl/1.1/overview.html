<p>OWL 1.1 extends the W3C OWL Web Ontology Language with a small but useful set
of features that have been requested by users, for which effective reasoning
algorithms are now available, and that OWL tool developers are willing to support.
The new features include extra syntactic sugar, additional property and qualified
cardinality constructors, extended datatype support, simple metamodelling, and
extended annotations. This document provides a high-level overview of these features.</p>

<h2><a name="1"></a>1 Overview</h2>

<p>The initial design of the W3C OWL Web Ontology Language (OWL) was conservative in
several ways. Constructs that did not have considerable support from within the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/">W3C Web Ontology Working Group</a>
were not included. Constructs for which effective reasoning methods were not
known or expected to be known in future were also not included.</p>

<p>Usage of OWL, particularly the OWL DL species of OWL, has identified
several constructs that are of considerable utility and that fit well
within the representation philosophy of OWL DL. Advances in the theory
of Description Logics have provided a basis for reasoning with constructs
that are not part of OWL, or not part of OWL DL.</p>

<p>For both these reasons, it was decided at the first
<a href="http://www.mindswap.org/2005/OWLWorkshop/">OWL: Experiences and Directions workshop</a>
to design an extension to the OWL DL species of OWL. The extension
is designed to provide simple extensions to OWL DL that</p>

<ol>
  <li>have been requested by major users of OWL DL;</li>
  <li>have effective reasoning methods, as evidenced by theoretical results; and</li>
  <li>are expected to be implemented by the developers of OWL DL reasoners.</li>
</ol>

<p>This document provides a high-level overview of OWL 1.1. The OWL 1.1 syntax document
[<cite><a  href="#ref-owl-1.1-specification">OWL 1.1 Syntax</a></cite>]
defines the normal syntax for OWL 1.1 and give
some informal information on the semantics of the new constructs. There
will be an OWL 1.1 semantics document that formally defines the
semantics of all of OWL 1.1, but the general intent is that the
semantics of OWL 1.1 is the same as that of
[<cite><a href="#ref-sroiq">SROIQ</a></cite>].
with a simple datatype theory.</p>


<h2><a name="2"></a>2 Features</h2>

<p>The features added in OWL 1.1 fall into four main categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>syntactic sugar to make some commonly-stated things easier to say;</li>
  <li>new Description Logic constructs;</li>
  <li>expanded datatype expressiveness; and</li>
  <li>metamodeling constructs.</li>
</ol>


<h3><a name="2.1"></a>2.1. Syntactic Sugar</h3>

<p>OWL 1.1 provides two constructs that are simply syntactic sugar, to
make some common idioms easier to write.</p>

<p>The first syntactic sugar construct, <span class="name">DisjointUnion</span>,
defines one description as the disjoint union of a set of descriptions.
It is simply a combination of a <span class="name">DisjointClasses</span>
axiom and an <span class="name">EquivalentClasses</span> axiom of
the first description as the union of the rest.</p>

<p>The second syntactic sugar construct is negative property membership
assertions <span class="name">NegativeObjectPropertyAssertion</span>
and <span class="name">NegativeDataPropertyAssertion</span>.</p>


<h3><a name="2.2"></a>2.2. <i>SROIQ</i></h3>

<p>OWL 1.1 provides extra Description Logic expressive power, moving
from the <i>SHOIN</i> Description Logic that underlies OWL DL to the <i>SROIQ</i>
Description Logic. The additions are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>qualified cardinality restrictions</dt>
  <dd>such as <span class="name">ObjectMinCardinality(2 friendOf hacker)</span>;</dd>

  <dt>local reflexivity restrictions</dt>
  <dd>on noncomplex properties only, such as <span class="name">ObjectExistsSelf(likes)</span> for narcissists;</dd>

  <dt>reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, and asymmetric properties</dt>
  <dd>for noncomplex properties only, such as <span class="name">ReflexiveObjectProperty(knows)</span> and <span class="name">IrreflexiveObjectProperty(husbandOf)</span>;</dd>

  <dt>disjoint properties</dt>
  <dd>for non-complex properties only, such as <span class="name">DisjointObjectProperties(childOf spouseOf)</span>; and </dd>

  <dt>property chain inclusion axioms</dt>
  <dd>such as <span class="name">SubObjectPropertyOf(SubObjectPropertyChain(owns part) owns)</span>, provided that there are no cyclic inclusions.</dd>

</dl>

<h3><a name="2.3"></a>2.3. Datatypes</h3>

<p>OWL 1.1 allows user-defined datatypes, using a mechanism similar to
that in Protege. User-defined datatypes can use most of the well-behaved
datatype facets available from
[<cite><a href="#ref-xml-schema-datatypes">XML Schema Datatypes</a></cite>].</p>

<p>This facility can be used in defining new datatypes that can be used in the ontology, as in
<span class="name">SubClassOf(Adult DataSomeValuesFrom(age DatatypeRestriction(xsd:integer minInclusive "18"^^xsd:integer))</span>.</p>

<p>Simple relationships between values of functional data-valued
properties can be used as restrictions, as in
<span class="name">DataSomeValuesFrom(shoeSize IQ greaterThan)</span>.
The underlying theory of datatypes used in these restrictions is taken from
[<cite><a href="#ref-xml-schema-datatypes">XML Schema Datatypes</a></cite>].</p>

<h3><a name="2.4"></a>2.4. Metamodeling and annotations</h3>

<p>In OWL 1.1 a name (such as <span class="name">Person</span>) can be
used as <em>any or all of</em> an individual, a class, or a property.
The computational problems that would arise if this were treated as in
RDF are avoided by ensuring that no aspect of the use of the name as an
individual has any effect on the meaning of the name as a class. Such
a treatment of metamodeling is often called <em>punning</em>.</p>
