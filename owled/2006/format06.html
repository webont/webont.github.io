<b>Workshop Format:
</b></p>

<p>
The goal of the workshop will be to maximise discussion. The technical
sessions will therefore consist of short presentations of papers
(grouped by topic area) followed by directed discussion. Further
presentations and system demonstrations will be made as part of a poster
session. The workshop may also have one session in common with the
Second International Conference on Rules and Rule Markup Languages for
the Semantic Web (RuleML06) in which the integration of OWL with rules
languages will be discussed.
