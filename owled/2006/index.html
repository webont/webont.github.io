<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>The W3C OWL Web Ontology Language has been a W3C recommendation
since
2004. OWL is playing an important role in an increasing number and
range
of applications, and is the focus of research into tools, reasoning
techniques, formal foundations, language extensions etc. This level of
experience with OWL means that the community is now in a good position
to discuss how OWL be applied, adapted and extended to fulfill current
and future application demands.
</p>
<p>
The OWL: Experiences and Direction (OWLED) workshop series is a forum
for
practitioners in industry and academia, tool developers, and others
interested in OWL to describe real and potential applications, to share
experience, and to discuss requirements for language
extensions/modifications. The workshop will bring users, implementors
and researchers together to measure the state of need against the state
of the art, and to set an agenda for research and deployment in order
to incorporate OWL-based technologies into new applications.
</p>
<p>
Building on the success of the 2005 OWLED workshop,
the 2006 OWLED workshop will again be immediately after the
<a href="http://iswc2006.semanticweb.org/">ISWC conference</a>, this
year held in Athens, Georgia, U.S.A.
</p>
<p>Topics of interest for OWLED 2006 include, but are not limited to
the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Applications of and experience with OWL </li>
  <li> Application-driven requirements for OWL </li>
  <li> Extensions to OWL, including:
    <ul>
      <li> non-monotonic extensions </li>
      <li> rules extensions </li>
      <li> extensions for representing temporal and spatial information
      </li>
      <li> extended property constructors </li>
      <li> keys </li>
      <li> extended class constructors </li>
      <li> extended datatype constructors </li>
      <li> probabilistic and fuzzy extensions </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Implementation techniques for OWL and related languages </li>
  <li> Performance and scalability issues </li>
  <li> Non-standard inference services, including explanations </li>
  <li> Security and Trust for OWL-based information </li>
  <li> Tools for OWL, including:
    <ul>
      <li> editors </li>
      <li> visualisation tools </li>
      <li> parsers and syntax checkers </li>
      <li> versioning frameworks </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> The workshop shall, in particular:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> further the interaction between theoreticians, tool builders,
and implementors </li>
  <li> help consolidating OWL 1.1 </li>
  <li> initiate the development of OWL 2.0 </li>
  <li> aid in clarifying the relationships between OWL and rules </li>
</ul>
<p> Submissions on any of the following topics are especially
encouraged:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Experiences with OWL 1.1 </li>
  <li> Implementation issues with OWL 1.1 </li>
  <li> Demos of OWL 1.1 implementations </li>
  <li> Requirements for a potential OWL 2.0 revision </li>
  <li> Modeling and reasoning with OWL and rules </li>
  <li> Survey papers </li>
  <li> System descriptions </li>
</ul>
<p> Submissions can be either technical papers or short "position"
papers. Submissions that base their conclusions on application
experience are especially encouraged. </p>
<p>
The goal of the workshop will be to maximise discussion. The technical
sessions will therefore consist of short presentations of papers
(grouped by topic area) followed by directed discussion.

<p>The goal of the workshop will be to maximise discussion. The
technical sessions will therefore consist of short presentations of
papers (grouped by topic area) followed by directed
discussion. Further presentations and system demonstrations will be
made as part of a poster session. The workshop may also have one
session in common with the <a href="http://2006.ruleml.org/">Second
International Conference on Rules and Rule Markup Languages for the
Semantic Web (RuleML06)</a> in which the integration of OWL with rules
languages will be discussed.
</p>
