The objective is to have an open and exciting discussion involving both
panellists and audience. To start the discussion, the moderator will
put to the panel a short list of questions on "hot topics" (see
below). Each panellist will then have a few minutes/slides (maximum 3
minutes/3slides) to summarise his/her response to the questions and/or
view on the topics (please note that, in order to ensure that there
is ample time for discussion, the moderator will strictly enforce the
3 minute/slide limit). There will follow an open discussion in which
both members of the panel and the audience will be invited to join
the discussion and/or put further questions to the panel.<BR><BR>
