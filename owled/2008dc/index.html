<p>
The fourth workshop in the
<a href="http://www.webont.org/owled/index.html"> The OWL: Experiences and Direction (OWLED) workshop  series</a> 
will again bring
users, implementors and researchers together in order to measure the
current state of need against the state of the art and to set an agenda
for language evolutions that satisfy users.  This OWLED workshop will
last two days and will be held in the Washington, D.C., area, in the
first week of April 2008.  The workshop will concentrate on issues
related to the development and W3C standardization of OWL 1.1, but other
issues related to OWL are also of interest, particularly those related
to the task forces set up at OWLED 2007.
</p>

<p>
As an "interim" workshop, the workshop will be more open and
unconstrained than recent OWLED workshops.  The workshop will have two
very different kinds of activities.  There will be formal presentation
of submissions to the workshop.  There will also be time devoted to
self-organizing groups discussing topics related to submissions to the
workshop and possibly other topics related to OWL.
</p>

<p>
Making this self-organization work will require effort on the part of
the attendees.  Workshop attendees should read submissions accepted at
the workshop before the workshop starts so that they can contribute to
the discussions at the workshop.  Attendees should also prepare single
"slides" that can be presented during these discussions.
</p>

<h2><a name="Submissions">Submissions</a></h2>

<p>
<em>
Late statements of interest can be sent in via the usual submission process
until 15 March.
These statements will not received full reviewing and might not be
included in the archives of the workshop, but will be available to
attendees of the workshop, and will be used to help schedule the
workshop.
</em>
</p>

<p>
Potential attendees who need official invitations to the workshop should
submit a short statement of interest (maximum 4 pages).  There will also
be open registration for the workshop.  Attendees who are not submitting
a formal paper are encouraged to submit a statement of interest.
</p>

<p>
Longer papers (up to 10 pages, LNCS style) can be submitted to the
workshop and space will be reserved for authors of accepted papers.  
Accepted papers will be made available to attendees before the workshop.
</p>

<p>
Papers about all aspects of OWL and extensions, application, theory,
method, and tools, are welcome at the workshop; 
including but not limited to the following topics: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Applications of OWL, particularly from industry </li>
  <li> Ontologies built using OWL, particularly large scale efforts </li>
  <li> Application-driven requirements for OWL </li>
  <li> Experience reports on using OWL </li>
  <li> Implementation techniques for OWL and related languages </li>
  <li> Performance and scalability issues </li>
  <li> Bridges between knowledge engineering and OWL</li>
  <li> Non-standard inference services, including explanations, static verification, modularity</li>
  <li> Enriching ontologies with rules</li>
  <li> Query answering and data integration</li>
  <li> Tools for OWL, including:
     editors,  visualisation tools, parsers and syntax checkers, versioning frameworks </li>
  <li> Extensions to OWL, including:
    <ul>
	  <li> extended datatype constructors, property constructors, class constructors </li>
	  <li> keys, constraints, rules  </li>
	  <li> probabilistic and fuzzy extensions, non-monotonic extensions, temporal and spatial extensions</li>   
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Systems demonstrations are also welcome.  Interested parties should
submit a short description (maximum 4 pages) of their demonstration.
</p>

<p>
The workshop will have a special emphasis on the state of OWL 1.1 and
topics related to the
<a href="http://www.webont.org/owled/taskforces/">OWLED Task Forces</a>.
Papers related to either of these, including reports from the task
forces, are particularly welcome.   It is expected that workshop time
will be reserved for a readout of the status of the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/OWL_Working_Group">W3C OWL WG</a>.
