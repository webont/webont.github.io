<p>
    The aim of the OWL:Experiences and Directions Workshop (OWLED) is to establish an international forum for the OWL
    community, where practitioners in industry and academia, tool developers and others interested in OWL can describe
    real and potential applications, share experience and discuss requirements for language extensions/modifications.
    The workshops aim at bringing all these groups together in order to pool their expertise, measure the state of need
    against the state of the art, and set an agenda for research and deployment in order to incorporate OWL-based
    technologies into new applications.
</p>

<p>
    This year, OWLED will be co-located with ESWC 2012 in Heraklion Crete. As usual, the workshop will try to encourage
    participants to work together and will give space for discussions of various topics as well as having presentation
    of submissions.
</p>

<h2>Latest news</h2>

<p>
<ul>
		<li><b>22rd April, Accepted papers <a href="./schedule.html">online</a></b>
				More informations about the tutorials and links to the final versions will be available within the next couple of weeks. 
    <li><b>18th April, Notifications are Out!</b>
        Congratulations, authors of the accepted papers! The competition this year was tougher than usual. In the end
				we accepted 12 technical papers for long (25mins) presentations, 6 technical papers for short (15 mins) presentations,
				8 system description papers, 2 hands-on tutorials, and 2 statement of interests. The list of accepted papers
				will be made available in the next couple of days.<br/>
				Camera-ready papers are due April 27th. The instructions are <a href="#submissions">the same</a>.
    </li>
    <li><b>3rd April, Notification Date Changed and Early Registration Deadline Extended</b>
        Due to the extension of the paper deadline we have had to push back the notification of acceptance date to the
        17th April.  We've also decided to push back the early registration deadline to the 22nd April to give people time
        to register after notification.
    </li>
    <li><b>8th March, Deadline Extended to the 24th of March</b>
        Due to several requests, and close proximity of deadlines for other workshops and conferences, we have decided
        to extend the paper submission deadline for OWLED 2012. The new deadline will be the 24th March 2012. This new
        deadline applies to any potential submissions, regardless of whether an abstract and title have already been
        submitted or not. If you have not already submitted an abstract, we would be grateful if you could submit one as
        soon as possible to assist with planning and review assignments. Please see the revised call for papers below.
    </li>
    <li><b>23rd February, 2nd Call for Papers Sent Out</b>
        Today we sent out the 2nd Call for Papers. Note that, the paper length limit has been increased slightly from
        the limit set in the first call.
        Technical papers may now be up to 12 pages in length, and System Description papers may now be up to 8 pages
        in length.
    </li>
    <li><b>Student support</b>
        Limited student support <i>may</i> be available and we encourage interested students to apply for it.
        The application should contain a letter from the supervisor plus an informal statement from the student
        explaining the need of funding.
        While we try to support as many students as possible, we will give preference to those with accepted papers.
        Please email your application to Pavel Klinov (pavel@clarkparsia.com) or Matthew Horridge
        (matthew.horridge@stanford.edu).

        invited speaker. Markus is a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science, University of
        Oxford. He obtained his Ph.D. at the Institute of Applied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AIFB) of
        the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in 2010. His research interest is the intelligent automatic
        processing of information, ranging from the foundations of formal knowledge representation to application areas
        like the Semantic Web. He is the lead developer of the successful Semantic Web application platform Semantic
        MediaWiki , co-editor of the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL 2) specification, chief maintainer of the
        semanticweb.org community portal, and co-author of the textbook Foundations of Semantic Web Technologies.

        The title and abstract will be made available later.
