<p>

This year OWLED features two 90 mins tutorials given by well-known members of the OWL community.
Each tutorial is a perfect opportunity to get your hands on specific OWL-based technologies and gain
invaluable experience for your next project. 
<br/>
Oh, and the best part: participation in both is included in the registration fee!

<h2>Introduction to Modularity for OWL Ontologies, May 27th, 14:00-15:30</h2>
by
<h3>Chiara Del Vescovo and Dmitry Tsarkov</h3>
<p>
<i>Abstract</i>
<br/>
This tutorial aims to give a taste of module-based ontology management. First, we introduce the concept of module along with various essential properties of modules.
Then, we explore modularity in the context of ontology reuse. Moreover, we
guide the participants through the use of tools to support modular ontology development. Finally, we briefly discuss other applications of modularity to ontology
engineering.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~tsarkov/" target="_blank">Dmitry Tsarkov</a> is a Description Logic Reasoner Implementer at the University of
Manchester, UK. His main task is to implement new techniques for the FaCT++ OWL 2 DL reasoner, of which he is the primary author. 
In addition to this, Dmitry’s interests are in non-standard Description
Logic inferences, knowledge management, and modularity of ontologies. Dmitry has published a number of papers about various aspects of reasoning in Description Logics.
<br/>
<a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~delvescc/" target="_blank">Chiara Del Vescovo</a> is a PhD student at the University of Manchester, UK. Her research
project deals with investigating the <i>Atomic Decomposition</i>, i.e. the modular structure
of OWL-based ontologies induced by locality-based modules. Her research interests span a wide
range of topics, from the formal semantics of the decomposition to possible applications in real world scenarios.
Chiara has given a number of talks at major conferences and workshops in the recent years, including
ISWC 2011 and IJCAI 2011. She graduated from the university Roma 3, from which she holds a degree in mathematics.

<h2>Evolution of OWL 2 QL and EL Ontologies, May 28th, 11:00-12:30</h2>
by
<h3>Bernardo Cuenca Grau, Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz, Evgeny Kharlamov and Dmitriy Zheleznyakov</h3>
<p>
<i>Abstract</i>
<br/>
This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of research on evolution of (OWL and RDF) ontologies. We give a high-level review of the field, and put special emphasis on (i) practically interesting issues, applications and system demos and (ii) particularly important research results, algorithms, and challenges. This tutorial does not have any specific prerequisites and should be accessible to all Semantic Web researchers and practitioners.
<br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bernardo.cuencagrau/" target="_blank">Bernardo Cuenca Grau</a> holds a prestigious University Research Fellowship from
the Royal Society. He is also a departmental lecturer at the Department of Computer
Science, University of Oxford, and a lecturer at Oriel College. Prior to that, he was a
Research Officer at the University of Oxford and a Research Fellow at the University of
Manchester. His Ph.D. research was fully funded by a prestigious fellowship from the
Spanish government, which allowed him to split his Ph.D. research between Spain and
the University of Maryland (USA). His doctoral and postdoctoral research has covered
many different aspects of ontology-based technologies, including (but not limited to)
modularity, reuse, formalisms and languages, automated reasoning, information hiding
and privacy, debugging and repair, management and versioning, as well as mapping and
integration. His research has been documented in the leading journals and conferences
in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (e.g., JAIR, AIJ, JAR, IJCAI, ECAI, AAAI, KR)
and Web technologies (e.g., WWW, JWS, ISWC). He has been the recipient of several
prestigious awards, including a Royal Society Fellowship, and an outstanding paper
award from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).
<br/>
<a href="http://krono.act.uji.es/people/Ernesto" target="_blank">Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz</a> is a postdoctoral research assistant at the Department of Computer Science,
 University of Oxford. In 2010 he got the doctor degree with honors in
Computer Science from the University Jaume I (Spain), under the supervision of Dr.
Rafael Berlanga Llavori and Dr. Bernardo Cuenca Grau. His Ph.D. research was fully
funded by a prestigious 4-years doctoral fellowship from the Valencian government. His
research has covered several areas, including bio-medical information processing and
integration, ontology/thesaurus reuse, ontology versioning, ontology/thesaurus mapping,
and application of thesaurus to text mining tasks. He has published in top-tier conferences (KR, ISWC, ESWC) and journals (DKE, BMC Bioinformatics). During his Ph.D
he visited several leading institutions in the UK, including the Text Mining Group at the
European Bio-informatics Institute in Cambridge, the Information Management Group
at University of Manchester, and the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now
Department of Computer Science).
<br/>
<a href="http://www.inf.unibz.it/~zheleznyakov/" target="_blank">Dmitriy Zheleznyakov</a> is a PhD candidate at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano
(FUB). He got his European M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from both Universidad
Politécnica de Madrid and Libera Università di Bolzano in 2009. He is an alumni
of the Novosibirsk State University, the Russian leading research school in several
applied mathematical disciples, where he studied mathematics. His research interests
focus around theoretical and algorithmic aspects of Semantic Web Technologies. He is
working under a supervision and together with Professor Diego Calvanese from FUB.
Dmitriy has published several papers in the leading conferences in the areas of Artificial
Intelligence and Web Technologies (KR, ISWC).
<br/>
<a href="https://www.inf.unibz.it/krdb/biblio/index.php/authors/show/292" target="_blank">Evgeny Kharlamov</a> is a research assistant at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano
(FUB), Italy, where he works in the team led by Diego Calvanese. He obtained his
PhD (2011) in computer science from FUB, while the actual research was conducted
in both FUB, under the supervision of Werner Nutt, and Télécom ParisTech, under the
supervision of Pierre Senellart. In 2011 Evgeny was a postdoctoral visiting researcher
at the Department of Computer Science of Oxford University working with Michael
Benedikt and at the University of Edinburgh working with Leonid Libkin. In 2009-2010
Evgeny was an intern and a research assistant at Inria Saclay, France, working with
Serge Abiteboul. His research interests focus around theoretical and algorithmic aspects
of the Semantic Web and database management systems. Evgeny has published papers
in top-tier conferences (VLDB, KR, ICDT, EDBT, ISWC) and journals (TODS).
