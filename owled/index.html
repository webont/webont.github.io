<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is playing an important role in
an
increasing number and range of applications, and is the focus of
research into tools, reasoning techniques, formal foundations and
language extensions. This level of experience with OWL means that
the community is now in a good position to discuss how OWL be
applied, adapted and extended to fulfil current and future
application demands. </p>
<p>The aim of the OWL:Experiences and Directions Workshop series is to
establish
an international forum for the OWL community, where practitioners in
industry and academia, tool developers and others interested in OWL can
describe real and potential applications, share experience and
discuss requirements for language extensions/modifications.
The workshops aim at bringing all these groups
together in order to pool their expertise,
measure the state of need against the state of the art, and set
an agenda for research and deployment in order to incorporate OWL-based
technologies into new applications. </p>
<p>
The OWLED Workshop series is organised by the <a href="steering.html">OWLED
Steering Committee</a>,
who are responsible for carrying out policy determined at OWLED
business meetings, and otherwise assisting the organizers of OWLED
workshops.</p>

<h2> History </h2>
<p>The <a href="2005/">first
OWL: Experiences and Directions Workshop</a> was held in
Galway, Ireland, on November 11-12 2005, just after <a
 href="http://iswc2005.semanticweb.org/">ISWC-2005</a>. The
workshop gathered a significant representation of theoreticians, tool
builders, vendors, users and customers of OWL-based technologies in
both industry and government organizations. At the workshop,
the attendees identified some deficiencies and infelicities in OWL
and decided to propose an extension of the language with a set of novel
features, grounded on recent theoretical advances in logic-based
Knowledge Representation and motivated by different application needs.
It was agreed that this extension, called <a
 href="http://www.webont.org/owl/1.1/">OWL
1.1</a>, should go forward to W3C as a <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">Member Submission</a>,
and the builders of many of the most widely used
Semantic Web tools, such as <a
 href="http://www.sts.tu-harburg.de/%7Er.f.moeller/racer/">RACER</a>, <a
 href="http://owl.man.ac.uk/factplusplus/">FaCT++</a>, <a
 href="http://www.mindswap.org/2003/pellet/index.shtml">Pellet</a>, <a
 href="http://protege.stanford.edu/download/prerelease-alpha/prototype.html">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a>
and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/swoop/">Swoop</a>
expressed a commitment to support the new features in the near
future. </p>
<p>The <a href="2006/">second
OWL: Experiences and Directions Workshop </a>was held in
Athens, Georgia, USA, on November 10-11 2006, just after <a
 href="http://iswc2006.semanticweb.org/">ISWC-2006</a>. The
workshop again gathered a significant representation of theoreticians,
tool
builders, vendors, users and customers of OWL-based technologies in
both industry and government organizations. After reviewing the OWL 1.1
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">Member Submission</a>,
it was agreed that this should be the starting point for a new W3C
Working Group whose goal would be to deliver a <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/"> W3C Recommendation</a>
based on OWL 1.1. Prototypical implementations of OWL 1.1 tools were
also demonstrated, including <a
 href="http://owl.man.ac.uk/factplusplus/">FaCT++</a>, <a
 href="http://www.mindswap.org/2003/pellet/index.shtml">Pellet</a>, <a
 href="http://protege.stanford.edu/download/prerelease-alpha/prototype.html">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;</a>
and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/swoop/">Swoop</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="2007/">third OWL: Experiences and Directions Workshop</a>
was held in Innsbruck, Austria, on 6-7 June 2007, in parallel with <a
 href="http://www.eswc2007.org//">ESWC-2007</a>.
The workshop coincided with the announcement of the announcement of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/OWL_Working_Group">W3C OWL
WG</a>, chartered to turn the OWL 1.1 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">Member Submission</a>
into a W3C recommendation.
At the workshop it was decided to start a number of 
<a href="http://webont.org/owled/taskforces/">Task Forces</a>, where
members of the OWL community can interact to gather information on,
requirements for, and designs of additions to the OWL language.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="2008dc/">fourth OWL: Experiences and Directions
Workshop</a>, an interim OWLED to fill the long gap between 
<a href="2007/">OWLED 2007</a> and <a href="2008/">OWLED 2008</a>,
was held in the Washington, DC, USA metropolitan area, on 1-2 April 2008, 
adjacent to the second face-to-face meeting of the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/OWL_Working_Group">W3C OWL WG</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="2008/">fifth OWL: Experiences and Directions
Workshop</a>
will be held in Karlsruhe, Germany, on 26-27 October 2008, 
with the <a href="http://iswc2008.semanticweb.org/">Seventh International
Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2008)</a>.
