<h1> OWL: Experiences and Directions Workshop Series</h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is playing an important role in
an
increasing number and range of applications, and is the focus of
research into tools, reasoning techniques, formal foundations and
language extensions. This level of experience with OWL means that
the community is now in a good position to discuss how OWL be
applied, adapted and extended to fulfil current and future
application demands. The OWL:Experiences and Directions Workshop series
constitute an international forum for the OWL community. The aim of the
workshops is to establish a forum for practitioners in
industry and academia, tool developers and others interested in OWL to
describe real and potential applications, to share experience and to
discuss requirements for language extensions/modifications.
The workshops aim at bringing users, implementors and researchers
together
to measure the state of need against the state of the art, and to set
an agenda for research and deployment in order to incorporate OWL-based
technologies into new applications. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mindswap.org/2005/OWLWorkshop/">First
OWL: Experiences and Directions Workshop</a> held at
Galway, Ireland, on November 11-12 2005, just after <a
 href="http://iswc2005.semanticweb.org/">ISWC-2005</a>. The
workshop gathered a significant representation of theoreticians, tool
builders, vendors, users and customers of OWL-based technologies 
in both industry and government organizations. At the workshop,
the attendees identified some deficiencies and lacks in OWL
and decided to propose an extension of the language with a set of novel
features, grounded on recent theoretical advances in logic-based
Knowledge Representation and motivated by different application needs.
The revision of OWL, called <a href="http://owl1_1.cs.manchester.ac.uk">OWL
1.1</a>, is an extension of OWL-DL, with a
well-defined <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/%7Ebcg/OWLSemantics.pdf">model-theoretic
semantics</a>. The builders of the major
Semantic Web reasoners, namely <a
 href="http://www.sts.tu-harburg.de/%7Er.f.moeller/racer/">RACER</a>, <a
 href="http://owl.man.ac.uk/factplusplus/">FaCT++</a>, <a
 href="http://www.mindswap.org/2003/pellet/index.shtml">Pellet</a>
and <a href="http://www.cerebra.com/">Cerebra</a>
expressed a committment to support the new features in the nearly
future. We expect that the OWL:Experiences and Directions workshops
will establish a forum for agreement on new extensions of the language
and will provide a key contribution to the success of OWL at all levels
of application, research and deployment.
