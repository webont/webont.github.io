Please send suggestions to <a href="mailto:bparsia@cs.man.ac.uk">Bijan Parsia</a>. This is not anything binding, but just a proposal.]</b></p><p>Given the necessarily limited time at an OWLED for
discussion and informed decision making, it is important that we have
some idea of what we can accomplish and how at a meeting. Much of the
work on OWLED generated specification necessarily takes place between
events. This document proposes a process that allows for effective,
distributed, minimal coordination of such work (on the one hand) and
effective decision making about that work at OWLED meetings.</p><h2>Specification statuses</h2><p>The concrete outcomesof OWLED are documents which specify something related to OWL. The canonical example is an <i>extension</i> or <i>change</i> to the OWL language, whether its syntax or its semantics. OWL 1.1 is an example of such a (collection of) specification(s).
OWL 1.1 was partially determined by whether it would actually change
the state of the deployed art...that is, whether the implementors would
actually implement it. Without a document in hand, it is very difficult
to decide, as a group, at an OWLED, whether we "endorse" some proposal.
On the other hand, there hasn't been a mechanism for new proposals to
be recognized in a non-ad-hoc way. This has not been a problem so far
since we've been working on OWL 1.1. But we need a new way forward.</p><p>Aside from papers, OWLED should accept <i>proposals</i> for consideration
and discussion. Given the scarcity of OWLED time, at an OWLED a
community should communicate to interested people what work they'd like
to consider at the next OWLED. There are three levels under which a
proposal may bepresented at an OWLED: </p><ol><li>Mature (Submission ready)</li><li>Maturing (Discussion ready)</li><li>Request for comment (A report)</li></ol><p>For a standardization session, the OWLED general chair will solicit
proposals for a report. The champion of that proposal will be given
time to present their arguments that the general area is ripe for OWLED
consideration (e.g., there are clear and widespread use cases with
users advocating them and there is enough robust work that it's
plausible that that standardization is possible in the subsequent few
years). After the presentation and discussion, the attendees will be
asked if they would like to see a more formal report at the next OWLED.
The report will summarize the state of the art on that topic and make a
recommendation as to what is worth trying to standardize.</p><p>If after the report, it is clear that there is something which:</p><ol><li>Meets the needs of a wide variety of users which would make OWL more attractive and useful</li><li>Gets the support of at least two major implementors (no commitment to implement yet)</li><li>Doesn't "break" or preclude supporting other stakeholders with different needs on this topic</li><li>Other considerations...let's not be too formalist about this!</li></ol><p>the
OWLED community may decide to ask for volunteers to flesh out the
recommendation into a spec for consideration at the next OWLED (and, of
course, for general mailing list discussion).</p><p>At the subsequent
OWLED, the volunteers will present their proposed spec (after having
solicited community feedback all along and having a reasonably mature
version of the spec for review a month before the meeting). If there
are already implementation (at least two) and widespread support and
the community considers it "ready", then the community can decide that
that spec will be submitted to a standards body (typically the W3C)
with the intention of pursing standardization of that spec. Otherwise,
the community can decide that it is not ready to pursue formal
standardization. There are a number of reasons for this. If the spec
isn't quite ready in the community opinion, but promising, they can as
the volunteers to present it again at the next meeting and for
implementors to commit to (trying to) implement it for that meeting.
The community may decide that its the wrong approach and rethink
things. Or, perhaps, the community might decide that the spec is
perfect, but, say, because of resource issues, its better to keep it
a&nbsp;<i>de facto</i> standard, rather than pursuing a&nbsp;<i>de jure</i> one at that time.</p><h2>For example</h2><h2>Be relaxed</h2><p>This
isn't meant to be a rigid process, but one way of organizing things. If
someone shows up at an OWLED with a worked out spec and a bunch of
implementation support, hurrah!</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&lt;address&gt;<br>This page maintained by &lt;a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~bparsia/"&gt;Bijan Parsia&lt;/a&gt;<br>&nbsp;&lt;/address&gt;</p></body></html>
