Specifications and Process:&nbsp;A Modest Proposal</h1><p><b>[Work
in progress. Please send suggestions to <a href="mailto:bparsia@cs.man.ac.uk">Bijan Parsia</a>.
This is not anything binding, but just a proposal.]</b></p><p>Given
the necessarily limited time at an OWLED for discussion and informed
decision making, it is important that we have some idea of what we can
accomplish and how at a meeting. Much of the work on OWLED generated
specification necessarily takes place between events. This document
proposes a process that allows for effective, distributed, minimal
coordination of such work (on the one hand) and effective decision
making about that work at OWLED meetings.</p><h2>Specification
statuses</h2><p>The concrete outcomes of OWLED are documents
which specify something related to OWL. The canonical example is an <i>extension</i>
or <i>change</i> to the OWL language, whether its syntax
or its semantics. OWL 1.1 is an example of such a (collection of)
specification(s). OWL 1.1 was partially determined by whether it would
actually change the state of the deployed art...that is, whether the
implementors would actually implement it. Without a document in hand,
it is very difficult to decide, as a group, at an OWLED, whether we
"endorse" some proposal. On the other hand, there hasn't been a
mechanism for new proposals to be recognized in a non-ad-hoc way. This
has not been a problem so far since we've been working on OWL 1.1. But
we need a new way forward.</p><p>Aside from papers, OWLED
should accept <i>proposals</i> for consideration and
discussion. Given the scarcity of OWLED time, at an OWLED a community
should communicate to interested people what work they'd like to
consider at the next OWLED. There are three levels under which a
proposal may be presented at an OWLED:</p><ol><li>Mature
(Submission ready)</li><li>Maturing (Discussion ready)</li><li>Request
for comment (A report)</li></ol><p>For a
standardization session, the OWLED general chair will solicit proposals
for a report. The champion of that proposal will be given time to
present their arguments that the general area is ripe for OWLED
consideration (e.g., there are clear and widespread use cases with
users advocating them and there is enough robust work that it's
plausible that that standardization is possible in the subsequent few
years). After the presentation and discussion, the attendees will be
asked if they would like to see a more formal report at the next OWLED.
The report will summarize the state of the art on that topic and make a
recommendation as to what is worth trying to standardize.</p><p>If
after the report, it is clear that there is something which:</p><ol><li>Meets
the needs of a wide variety of users which would make OWL more
attractive and useful</li><li>Gets the support of at least
two major implementors (no commitment to implement yet)</li><li>Doesn't
"break" or preclude supporting other stakeholders with different needs
on this topic</li><li>Other considerations...let's not be
too formalist about this!</li></ol><p>the OWLED
community may decide to ask for volunteers to flesh out the
recommendation into a spec for consideration at the next OWLED (and, of
course, for general mailing list discussion).</p><p>At the
subsequent OWLED, the volunteers will present their proposed spec
(after having solicited community feedback all along and having a
reasonably mature version of the spec for review a month before the
meeting). If there are already implementation (at least two) and
widespread support and the community considers it "ready", then the
community can decide that that spec will be submitted to a standards
body (typically the W3C) with the intention of pursing standardization
of that spec. Otherwise, the community can decide that it is not ready
to pursue formal standardization. There are a number of reasons for
this. If the spec isn't quite ready in the community opinion, but
promising, they can as the volunteers to present it again at the next
meeting and for implementors to commit to (trying to) implement it for
that meeting. The community may decide that its the wrong approach and
rethink things. Or, perhaps, the community might decide that the spec
is perfect, but, say, because of resource issues, its better to keep it
a&nbsp;<i>de facto</i> standard, rather than pursuing
a&nbsp;<i>de jure</i> one at that time.</p><h2>For
example</h2><p>For OWLED 2007, I think SPARQL/OWL (at least, conjunctive abox query with variables in the predicate position, but also
restricted mixed TBox/ABox queries) is ready to request a submission
ready spec for the next OWLED. We know how to do it. There are multiple
implementations. SPARQL is hot and about to reach recommendation
status. The working group is not going to take on that work (and can't,
by its charter). And it is being <i>heavily</i> used, even on OWL and people want to use more. Even a W3C member&nbsp;submission would be enough to do a great deal of good for OWL.</p><p>DL
Safe rules are fairly well understood, but there's only one really
robust implementation at the moment (in KAON2; there's an experimental
implementation in Pellet). They are easy to specify (at least the core)
and there is a fair amount of desire for rules of some sort, and for
features that could be usefully subsumed by DL Safe rules (e.g.,
inverse functional properties on datatypes for named individuals only).
However, there are extra features one could add (builtins, SPARQL like
higher order features), and some alternatives (e.g., non-monotonic
description logic programs). So, it makes sense to request a spec for discussion at the next OWLED. (Of course, if it catches fire, we can adjust).</p><p>Temporal
features are clearly important with users increasingly requesting them
(I've had several people request this for the OWL 2.0 space). But there
are <i>lots</i> of possibilities and few worked out proposals and implementations (as an extension to OWL). So, it would make sense at this OWLED to solicit volunteers to generate a <i>report</i> for the next OWLED. This could consist of motivating use cases, decision trees explaining tradeoffs, solicitation of prototypes, etc.</p><h2>Thinking about features</h2><p>In a <a href="http://clarkparsia.com/weblog/2007/05/28/owled-2007-is-nigh/">blog post</a>, I described a slightly different taxonomy for features and proposals, simplifying and generalizing it a bit, we have:</p><ol><li>OWL 1.x -- small, well known, easy to implement, good wins, not a lot of reconciliation of viewpoint needed, etc.</li><li>OWL 2.0 -- things which are technically or politically (or both!) difficult to achieve in the next few years</li><li>OWL-Adjuncts
-- things which are more or less language features, but can be also
thought of as separate; query and rules come to mind, but also
alternative syntaxes; one might put DIG and similar things here.&nbsp;</li></ol>This
seems helpful. We can expect to thing submission for OWL 1.x stuff,
reports on OWL 2.0 stuff, and discussion on things in between.
OWL-Adjuncts may have different levels of maturity, but they also are a
bit separable.<h2>Where does the between OWLED work get done?</h2><p>In order to faciliate participation and predictability, we should:</p><ol><li>Continue to use <a href="public-owl-dev@w3.org">public-owl-dev@w3.org</a> as the discussion mailing list.</li><li>Continue to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/">http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/</a> for spec development. The name is a bit historical, so we could migrate to a new project if we really cared about that.</li><li>Publish drafts and versions on the <a href="http://webont.org/">http://webont.org/</a> website.</li><ul><li>Disclosure: <a href="http://webont.org/">http://webont.org/</a> hosting is currently donated by Clark &amp; Parsia, LLC. This does not affect editorial control, as the website is generated from the Google Code SVN repository.</li></ul></ol><h2>Be relaxed</h2><p>This
isn't
meant to be a rigid process, but a way of organizing things. It's meant
to help provide some predictability and even more transparency. If
someone shows up at an OWLED with a worked out spec and a bunch of
implementation support, hurrah!<br></p><address>This
