<h2>Membership Policy</h2>

<p>
The steering committee is currently formed according to the following policy:
</p>


<ol>
<li>The steering committee consists of 6 people.
</li>
<li>Membership in the steering committee expires after three years.
</li>
<li>The general chairs of OWLED workshops automatically become members of the steering committee for three years, starting from the year when the workshop takes place. If they have been members of the steering committee in the year before the workshop, then their term is extended by three years, starting from the year of the workshop.
</li>
<li>Normally, one new member is elected annually at the OWLED Workshop business meeting (using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system">Two-round system</a>). In case the general chair of the workshop is already a member of the steering committee (see 3. above), a second new member is elected.
</li>
</ol>

In order to get the circulation in place, the procedure will be altered as follows.

<ol>
<li> In 2008, the 2008 general chair plus one other person join, while one of the legacy members from 2007 drops out (voluntarily or by a random draw).
</li>
<li> In 2009, the 2009 general chair plus one other person join, while two of the legacy members from 2007 drop out (voluntarily or by a random draw).
</li>
<li>In 2010, the 2010 general chair plus one other person joins, while
  the final legacy member from 2007 drop out.
</li>
</ol>
