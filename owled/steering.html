<h2>Membership Policy</h2>

<p>
The steering committee is currently formed according to the following policy:
</p>


<ol>
<li>The steering committee consists of six or more people.
</li>
<li>Membership in the steering committee expires after three years.
</li>
<li>The general chairs of OWLED workshops automatically become members of the steering committee for three years, starting from the year when the workshop takes place. If they have been members of the steering committee in the year before the workshop, then their term is extended by three years, starting from the year of the workshop.
</li>
<li>Normally, one new member is elected annually at the OWLED Workshop business meeting (using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system">two-round system</a>). In case the general chair of the workshop is already a member of the steering committee (see 3. above), a second new member is elected.
</li>
<li>The steering committee may appoint new members of the steering
  committee, for example to fill a vacancy or to add a representative
  from a particular group.
</ol>

The procedure is been altered as follows to start the process:

<ol>
<li> In 2008, the 2008 general chair joined and two members were elected, while
  one of the legacy members from 2007 dropped out.  Bijan Parsia 
  dropped out to leave room for the second elected member.
</li>
<li> In 2009, the 2009 general chair plus one other person will join,
  while two of the remaining legacy members from 2007 drop out (voluntarily or by a random draw).
</li>
<li>In 2010, the 2010 general chair plus one other person will join, while
  the final legacy member from 2007 drops out.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>OWLED Business Sessions Minutes</h2>

<h3>OWLED 2008</h3>

<p>
<b>OWLED Steering Committee:</b>
The scheduled changes for the steering committee were that
Bernardo Cuena Grau drops off, Alan Ruttenberg joins, and we elect one
new member.
Two members were nominated for election, Michel Dumontier and Melanie Courtot.
Bijan Parsia volunteered to drop out to allow both of them to join,
which was accepted with no dissension.
</p>

<p>
<b>OWLED 2009:</b>
It was decided that <a href="2009/">OWLED 2009</a> will be held adjacent
to <a href="http://iswc2009.semanticweb.org/">ISWC 2009</a>
in late October in the Washington, DC, USA, area.
OWLED 2009 will probably be held in the offices of 
<a href="http://clarkparsia.com/">Clark&amp;Parsia</a>, in downtown Washington,
DC. 
OWLED 2009 will not overlap both tutorial/workshop days of ISWC 2009 and
will not overlap <a href="http://www.rr-conference.org/">RR</a> 2009.
Potential attendees are encouraged to look for hotel bargains.
</p>

<p>
<b>Community activities:</b>
There was interest in Description Graphs at the "breakout" session.   A
wiki page will be set up in
the <a href="http://wiki.webont.org/page/OWLED_Wiki">OWLED Wiki</a>,
initialized with information 
from the session.  The community will update this page to come up with a
design for an addition to OWL.<br />
There will be a pointer to the Wiki from the main OWLED pages.
The Wiki may merge with the
larger <a href="http://semanticweb.org/wiki/Main_Page">Semantic Web
  wiki</a>.
Community members were reminded that the OWLED Wiki is their wiki; if
they don't make changes the wiki will die.
</p>

<h3>OWLED 2009</h3>

<p>
<b>OWLED Steering Committee:</b>
The scheduled changes for the steering committee were that two legacy
members were to drop off, the general chair for OWLED 2009 was to be
added, and one new member elected.
As Peter Patel-Schneider was the general chair for OWLED 2009, the
steering committee decided to give this spot to Kendall Clarke, a
general chair for OWLED 2008DC.  Pascal Hitzler and Ian Horrocks dropped
off.  Rinke Hoekstra was selected by acclamation.
</p>

<p>
<b>OWLED 2010:</b>
There was considerable discussion on where to have OWLED 2010, as ISWC
2010 will be in China.  There was support for having OWLED with SemTech
(San Francisco, June), or RR 2010 (Bressanone, Sept), or European
SemTech (Vienna, Dec).  Peter Patel-Schneider volunteered to start work
on seeing whether having OWLED with SemTech would be viable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Community activities:</b>
There was interest in having a community tutorial for OWL, perhaps for
presentation at SemTech.
