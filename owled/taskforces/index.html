<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>A core rationale of the OWLED workshop series is to align the state
of the deployed art of OWL with widespread and critical user needs. At
the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2005/">first OWLED</a>,
participants identified a set of features that met significant user
needs and were deemed reasonable for implementors. By the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2006/">second OWLED</a>, these features
were rolled into an extension of OWL called <a href="http://webont.org/owl/1.1/">OWL 1.1</a> and there was
significant <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2006/acceptedLong/submission_15.pdf">implementor</a>
<a href="http://clarkparsia.com/weblog/2006/11/15/56/">experience</a>.
The participants decided to submit the OWL 1.1 specifications as a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">W3C member submission</a>
and pursue a W3C working group to standardize OWL 1.1.</p>




<p>By the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2007/">third OWLED</a>, OWL
1.1 was an accepted W3C member submission and movement toward a
possible working group was underway. At this point, stewardship of OWL
1.1 could no longer be a focus of OWLED workshops. In order to guide
future standardization (both <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i>) work, the participants at OWLED requested of various people to form <i>task forces</i> to produce specifications and reports for discussion and ratification at subsequent OWLED meetings.</p>



<h2>Structure</h2>


<p>There are two sorts of task forces distinguished by their expected
outcomes. An OWLED meeting can request that a task force produce a <i>specification suitable for standardization</i>
if the participants feel that an area is mature enough (both
technically and in terms of user needs and understanding) that they are
confident that the task force can produce by the next meeting a spec
with enough experience and consensus behind it to be appropriate for,
e.g., a W3C member submission. An OWLED meeting can also request that a
task force produce a <i>report or proposal</i> to be a basis of
discussion for at the next OWLED. These categories are intended to be
suggestive rather than rigid and to reflect the general consensus and
understanding of the OWLED meeting.</p>


<h3>Specification suitable for standardization</h3>


<p>Requesting a specification is intended to be&nbsp; analogous to the
agreement to work toward OWL 1.1 expressed at OWLED 2005 with a result
akin to the state of OWL 1.1 at the time of OWLED 2006. That is, the
goal is a set of specifications of such quality and backed by
implementation experience and user approval sufficient to serve as a
foundation of a formal standardization effort. Typcially, a spec will
only be requested if the participants have reasonable confidence that
their is broad (if tacit) consensus on a technical design.</p>


<p>It is reasoanble for an OWLED to expect:</p>


<ul>


  <li>Documents specifying the technology<br>

  </li>

  <li>Reports on implementation experience and some broad endorsement by implementors</li>

  
  <ul>

    <li>In particular, having some major implementors having already implemented the design is highly desirable.<br>

    </li>

  
  </ul>

  <li>Reports on user experience</li>

</ul>


<p>It is reasonable for task force members to expect:</p>


<ul>


  <li>Engagment from implementors and users (esp. from among the participants)</li>

  <li>Significant presentation time at an OWLED</li>

</ul>


<h3>Report/Proposal</h3>



<p>There were several areas that were clearly of great interest to
OWLED participants but about which the participants did not have a lot
of confidence. A good example were "rules". Many user papers <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pTmcCXR-dV6TdDo24Tse-fQ">identified</a>
some sort of "rules" as a requirement, but there was no clear
understanding of what sort of rules (exactly) were wanted and feasible.
What was lacking were sufficient material and understanding to make an
informed choice. A report is intended to gather up enough information
to allow participants at the subsequent OWLED to make effective
decisions. A report may include:</p>


<ul>


  <li>A survey of exisitng work in an area</li>

  <li>Use cases, requirements, and case studies<br>

  </li>

  <li>A decision tree including tradeoffs</li>

  <li>A preliminary design with alternative choices clearly explained</li>

  <li>Prototypical implementation experience</li>

  <li>A recommendation on how to proceed<br>

  </li>

</ul>


<p>It would perfectly reasonable for a report to say that an area is not ready for standardization.</p>


<p>It is reasonable for an OWLED to expect:</p>


<ul>


  <li>Enough breath so they feel that they understand the range of possibilities in the area</li>

  <li>Enough concrete examples so they can reasonably extrapolate to their own needs</li>

</ul>


<p>It is reasonable for task force members to expect:</p>


<ul>


  <li>Presentation and discussion time at an OWLED</li>

  <li>Participants to review the report before the OWLED<br>

  </li>

</ul>


<h2>Participation</h2>



<p>Each task force was appointed at least one "point person" who agreed
to be responsible to the group for the work. However, they are expected
to solicit and accept help as needed and offered in order to do the
work. The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/">OWL 1.1 Google Code site</a> (especially the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/issues/list">issues list</a> and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/w/list">wiki</a> -- see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/wiki/TaskForces">coordination page</a>), <a href="http://webont.org/owled/taskforces/">webont.org</a>, and the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/">public-owl-dev@w3.org</a> mailing lists are the primary venues for task force business. There is also a coordination list for task force leaders: <a href="mailto:taskforces@lists.webont.org">taskforces@lists.webont.org</a>. Interest in participation may be directed there, or to individual point people.</p>


<p>Since time at OWLED is limited and there are already quite a few
task forces, each task force should make its work products available in
"final" form at least one month and preferably two months before the
meeting. Of course, the task forces, especially for specifications, should be making an ongoing effort at outreach.</p>
