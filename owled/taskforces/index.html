<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A core rationale of the OWLED workshop series is to align the state
of the deployed art of OWL with widespread and critical user needs. At
the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2005/">first OWLED</a>,
participants identified a set of features that met significant user
needs and were deemed reasonable for implementors. By the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2006/">second OWLED</a>, these features
were rolled into an extension of OWL called <a href="http://webont.org/owl/1.1/">OWL 1.1</a> and there was
significant <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2006/acceptedLong/submission_15.pdf">implementor</a>
<a href="http://clarkparsia.com/weblog/2006/11/15/56/">experience</a>.
The participants decided to submit the OWL 1.1 specifications as a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">W3C member submission</a>
and pursue a W3C working group to standardize OWL 1.1.</p>

<p>By the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2007/">third OWLED</a>, OWL
1.1 was an accepted W3C member submission and movement toward a
possible working group was underway, so participants faced the
question: What next?</p>
