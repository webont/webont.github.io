<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A core rationale of the OWLED workshop series is to align the state
of the deployed art of OWL with widespread and critical user needs. At
the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2005/">first OWLED</a>,
participants identified a set of features that met significant user
needs and were deemed reasonable for implementors. By the <a
 href="http://webont.org/owled/2006/">second OWLED</a>, these features
were rolled into an extension of OWL called <a
 href="http://webont.org/owl/1.1/">OWL 1.1</a> for which there was
significant <a
 href="http://webont.org/owled/2006/acceptedLong/submission_15.pdf">implemention</a>
<a href="http://clarkparsia.com/weblog/2006/11/15/56/">experience</a>.
The participants decided to submit the OWL 1.1 specifications as a <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">W3C member submission</a>
and pursue a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/06/OWLCharter">W3C
working group</a> to standardize OWL 1.1.</p>
<p>By the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2007/">third OWLED</a>, OWL
1.1 was an accepted W3C member submission and movement toward a
possible working group was underway. At this point, stewardship of OWL
1.1 could no longer be a focus of OWLED workshops. In order to guide
future standardization (both <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto"><i>de facto</i></a> and <i><a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure">de jure</a></i>) work, the
participants at OWLED requested that <i>task forces</i> be created to
produce specifications and reports for discussion and ratification at
subsequent OWLED meetings.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>There are two sorts of task forces distinguished by their expected
outcomes. An OWLED meeting can request that a task force produce a <i>specification
suitable for standardization</i>
if the participants feel that an area is mature enough (both
technically and in terms of user needs and understanding) that they are
confident that the task force can produce by the next meeting a spec
with enough experience and consensus behind it to be appropriate for,
e.g., a W3C member submission. An OWLED meeting can also request that a
task force produce a <i>report or proposal</i> to be a basis of
discussion for at the next OWLED. These categories are intended to be
suggestive rather than rigid and to reflect the general consensus and
understanding of the OWLED meeting.</p>
<h3>Specification suitable for standardization</h3>
<p>Requesting a specification is intended to be analogous to the
agreement to work toward OWL 1.1 expressed at OWLED 2005 with a result
akin to the state of OWL 1.1 at the time of OWLED 2006. That is, the
goal is a set of specifications of such quality and backed by
implementation experience and user approval sufficient to serve as a
foundation of a formal standardization effort. Typically, a
specification will
only be requested if the participants have reasonable confidence that
their is broad (if tacit) consensus on a technical design.</p>
<p>It is reasonable for OWLED participants to expect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documents specifying the technology<br>
  </li>
  <li>Reports on implementation experience and some broad endorsement
by implementors. In particular, it is highly desirable that some major
implementors will have already implemented the design.</li>
  <li>Reports on user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>It is reasonable for task force members to expect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engagement from implementors and users (esp. from among the
participants)</li>
  <li>Significant presentation time at an OWLED workshop</li>
</ul>
<h3>Report/Proposal</h3>
<p>There were several areas that were of great interest to OWLED
participants but for which there was not concensus that standardization
was (yet) appropriate. One example was "rules". Many user papers <a
 href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pTmcCXR-dV6TdDo24Tse-fQ">identified</a>
some sort of "rules" as a requirement for a future specification, but
there was no clear
understanding of what sort of rules (exactly) were wanted and feasible.
What was lacking were sufficient material and understanding to make an
informed choice. That report is intended to gather up enough
information
to allow participants at the subsequent OWLED to make effective
decisions about how to proceed. A different sort of case is that of the
Education task force, where the output would be materials of general
use to the OWL user community.
</p>
<p>Reports may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A survey of existing work in an area</li>
  <li>Use cases, requirements, case studies or other documentation that
could be helpful to the community<br>
  </li>
  <li>A decision tree organizing a set of tradeoffs</li>
  <li>A preliminary design with alternative choices clearly explained</li>
  <li>Experience with a prototype implementation </li>
  <li>A recommendation on how to proceed<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It would perfectly reasonable for a report to say that an area is
not ready for standardization.</p>
<p>It is reasonable for OWLED participants to expect the report to
include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enough breadth so they feel that they understand the range of
possibilities in the area</li>
  <li>Enough concrete examples so they can reasonably extrapolate to
their own needs</li>
</ul>
<p>It is reasonable for task force members to expect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Presentation and discussion time at an OWLED workshop</li>
  <li>Participants to review the report before the workshop</li>
</ul>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Each task force was appointed at least one "point person" who agreed
to be responsible to the group for the work. However, the point person
is expected to solicit and accept help as needed and offered in order
to do the work. The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/">OWL 1.1
Google Code site</a> (especially the <a
 href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/issues/list">issues list</a> and
the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/w/list">wiki</a> -- see
the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owl1-1/wiki/TaskForces">coordination
page</a>), <a href="http://webont.org/owled/taskforces/">webont.org</a>,
and the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/">public-owl-dev@w3.org</a>
mailing lists are the primary venues for task force business. There is
also a coordination list for task force leaders: <a
 href="mailto:taskforces@lists.webont.org">taskforces@lists.webont.org</a>.
Interest in participation may be directed there, or to individual point
people.</p>
<p>Since time at OWLED is limited, each task force should make its work
products available in
"final" form at least one month and preferably two months before the
meeting. Of course, the task forces, especially for specifications,
should be making an ongoing effort at outreach.</p>
<p>The task force coordinator and the OWLED general chair (in
consultation, if necessary, with the steering committee) determine the
precise schedule and form of task force presentations at any given
OWLED. They shall balance the progress of the task force, the
submissions and expressed interest of attendees, and the likeliness of
successful decisions being made on the basis of task force work in
determining the schedule.<br>
