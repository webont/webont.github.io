<h2>Overview</h2>


<p>A core rationale of the OWLED workshop series is to align the state
of the deployed art of OWL with widespread and critical user needs. At
the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2005/">first OWLED</a>,
participants identified a set of features that met significant user
needs and were deemed reasonable for implementors. By the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2006/">second OWLED</a>, these features
were rolled into an extension of OWL called <a href="http://webont.org/owl/1.1/">OWL 1.1</a> and there was
significant <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2006/acceptedLong/submission_15.pdf">implementor</a>
<a href="http://clarkparsia.com/weblog/2006/11/15/56/">experience</a>.
The participants decided to submit the OWL 1.1 specifications as a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/10/">W3C member submission</a>
and pursue a W3C working group to standardize OWL 1.1.</p>


<p>By the <a href="http://webont.org/owled/2007/">third OWLED</a>, OWL
1.1 was an accepted W3C member submission and movement toward a
possible working group was underway. At this point, stewardship of OWL
1.1 could no longer be a focus of OWLED workshops. In order to guide
future standardization (both <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i>) work, the participants at OWLED requested of various people to form <i>task forces</i> to produce specifications and reports for discussion and ratification at subsequent OWLED meetings.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
There are two sorts of task forces distinguished by their expected
outcomes. An OWLED meeting can request that a task force produce a <i>specification suitable for standardization</i>
if the participants feel that an area is mature enough (both
technically and in terms of user needs and understanding) that they are
confident that the task force can produce by the next meeting a spec
with enough experience and consensus behind it to be appropriate for,
e.g., a W3C member submission. An OWLED meeting can also request that a
task force produce a <i>report or proposal</i> to be a basis of discussion for at the next OWLED.<br>
